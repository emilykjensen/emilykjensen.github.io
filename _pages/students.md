This page has a collection of questions I frequently get asked by students.

# How do I get involved with your research?

There are two ways to get involved. The first is working as a summer research assistant, where you get paid to work full-time for several weeks. This option is good for students who are new to research and need some time to build skills and get immersed in the project. This option is also good for continuing students. The second option is to develop an independent study project, where you get course credit to work with me over a semester. This option is good for students who have a project idea and are ready to work with minimal supervision. If you have not taken a class with me and have not previously worked with me on research, independent study is problably not a good option.

Summer research positions are posted on Handshake midway through the Spring semester. You will apply through Handshake. You are encouraged to come chat with me before you apply so I can learn more about your interests and background. You can also ask me about the project details and what specific skills I am looking for.

If you are interested in doing an independent study project, contact me at least one month before classes start for the semester. This gives us enough time to figure out project details and sign any necessary paperwork. If you want to do an independent study, it is your responsibility to come up with a project idea and an initial idea of how you want to approach it. This shows me that you are ready to work independently. Your idea does not need to be perfect; I am happy to figure out details with you. Your proposed project should be somehow related to my current research projects. You can learn more about the type of work I do by reading some of my [published papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=00dobVoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&authuser=3&sortby=pubdate) and looking at the rest of my website.
