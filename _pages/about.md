Hi there, I'm Emily!

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://colorado.edu/cs) and the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://colorado.edu/ics) at CU Boulder advised by [Sriram Sankaranarayanan](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/index.html) and [Brad Hayes](http://www.bradhayes.info/). In general, I'm interested in using autonomous systems to teach people complex tasks. You can read a formal write-up of my work on my [docs page](https://emilykjensen.com/docs/).

One of my goals is to maintain a life outside of academia; depending on the day, you can find me drinking tea, reading dystopian novels, knitting, running or hitting the trails (sometimes at the same time), and messing around on my piano. I also sporadically post an [open notebook of sorts](https://emilykjensen.com/blog/) on this site to show that goals, motivation, and progress through academia (and life) isn't anywhere close to linear.

As someone with interests at the intersection of a lot of different fields, I really struggled through the graduate school application process. On top of that, I didn't know what to look for in a program or what the daily life of a graduate student looked like. If you have questions about these as well, I would be [happy to chat](mailto:emily.jensen@colorado.edu) about my experience or connect you with someone else.
