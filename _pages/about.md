Hello!

I'm an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science at Franklin & Marshall College](https://fandm.edu/fields-of-study/computer-science/index.html). I received a joint Ph.D. in Computer Science and Cognitive Science from the University of Colorado Boulder.

My research focuses on building adaptive training systems that help people learn complex psychomotor tasks (these require both mental and physical coordination). I draw inspiration from educational theories and pair these with computational tools from intelligent tutoring systems and formal methods research.

I want to do my part in promoting transparency about the academic career path. To support this, I've posted the [documents](https://emilykjensen.com/docs/) I wrote for my job applications. I also sporadically post an [open notebook of sorts](https://emilykjensen.com/blog/) on this site to show that goals, motivation, and progress through academia (and life) isn't anywhere close to linear. As someone with interests at the intersection of a lot of different fields, I struggled through the graduate school application process. I didn't know what to look for in a program or what the daily life of a graduate student looked like. If you have questions about these as well, I would be [happy to chat](mailto:ejensen@fandm.edu) about my experience or connect you with someone else.
